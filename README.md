# Terrorism-Analysis

This project is based on Data Visualization of Terrorsim. In this we will analyse the world terror data and we will visualize it in the webpage by using Dash. Dash is a python library which is used to create a web page.
In this we analyze the world data and visualize it in the world map. We also visualize the data in chart form. In the world map we have various filters we can filter the data according to month, date, region, country, province, city and also the range of year which we want. We also have the separate tab for India Terror analysis in which we can apply the same filters to customize the india terrorism data. In the chart tool we have various categories which we can show on the chart like region wise, type of attack, etc. In chart tools we also have a search option in which we can search the category which we want.
